Planting wheel equipped with encoder providing 0.1 degrees, or .45 millimeters along the row.
Also used optical encoder on unpowered wheel to measure transplanter distance with resolution of 0.6 mm.
Optical light-beam based sensor to detect when a plant passed through the beam.  1 meter behind planter to allow plant to settle. 
3 triggers - plant encoder, wheel encoder, GPS PPS,
Used a 1PPS output on GPS.
