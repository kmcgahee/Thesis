I would like to thank Dr. Jesse Poland and the National Science Foundation for the opportunity to complete this research.  Dr. Dale Schinstock for being a great mentor and always keeping me pointed in the right direction on my studies.  Ethan Wells for helping in the development of the data collection program.  Dr. Kevin Wang for his work on the first version of the camera triggering interface.  Josh Sharon for welding the top frame attached to the robot, and Byron Evers for helping me transport the robot to Salina.   Most importantly I'd like to thank my loving parents and sisters, because without them I wouldn't be anywhere close to where I am today.
