Developments in farm related technology have increased the importance of mapping individual plants in the field.  An automated mapping process allows the size of these fields to scale up without being hindered by time-intensive, manual surveying.  This research focuses on the development of a mapping process, which uses geo-located images of the field to automatically locate plants and determine their coordinates.  Additionally, this mapping process is capable of differentiating between groupings of plants by using Quick Response (QR) codes.  This research applies to plants that have been grown into seedlings before being planted, known as transplants, in a standard row configuration. 

The development of this mapping process is presented in two stages.  First is the design of a platform capable of traversing the field and capturing images, and second is the post-processing steps which convert the images into a field map.  This mapping system was applied to a field at the Land Institute containing roughly 25,000 plants. The results show the mapped plant locations are accurate to within a few inches, and the use of QR codes is effective for identifying plant groups.  These results demonstrate this method is successful in mapping large fields.  However, the high overall complexity makes the system restrictive for smaller fields, where a simpler, semi-automated solution is preferable. An example of such a system is presented at the conclusion of the thesis.
