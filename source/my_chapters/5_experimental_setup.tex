\chapter{Experimental Setup}
\label{chapter:experiment}

The mapping system was evaluated at the Land Institute on a type of intermediate wheat grass, commonly referred to as Kernza.  The Land Institute is a research organization located in Salina, Kansas, focused on using perennial crops to develop sustainable farming practices.  The experiment, which was overseen by researcher Lee DeHaan, consisted of approximately 25,000 plants that were transplanted during the middle of October.  Details about how the field was setup as well as different robot and camera settings are discussed in this chapter.

\section{Field Setup}
\label{section:field_setup}

A two-row model 5000WD planter from Mechanical Transplanters was used to transplant the kernza seedlings into the field.  The transplanter works by a series of six deposit cylinders rotating at a constant rate.  When a cylinder passes over the correct spot, its bottom flap is opened and the plant is ejected.  The yellow water tanks seen in figure \ref{figure:transplanter} are used to automatically apply a small amount of water to the plant, and then the rolling wheels help press the soil down.

\end{figure}  

The six deposit cylinders rotate so that each cylinder is spaced approximately 12 inches apart. For this experiment plants were placed in every other cylinder, which resulted in 24 inches between successive plants.  The QR codes indicating the start of a new group are placed in the empty cylinders between two plants so that the use of QR codes does not increase the overall size of the field. The spacing between the two rows on the transplanter was set to 36 inches, and this same spacing was used between each pass.  Therefore the entire field had consistent row-spacing. 

The plants were split into 97 individual rows, roughly 180 meters long.  After the field was planted, the QR code marking the start and end of each row were manually placed.  The field contained a total of 4581 QR codes.  Of these codes, 3619 corresponded to a plant grouping containing only a single plant.  The other 962 codes corresponded to plant groupings containing, on average, 25 plants.  

\section{Mapping Window}

An important decision for the mapping system is whether to collect images during the day or at night.  The biggest challenge of mapping during the day is the ability to provide consistent lighting.  Changes in scene lighting, for example between clouds and direct sun, can affect the color of plants and blue sticks and potentially cause under or over-exposure of QR codes.  Daytime lighting can be made more consistent by using a shade cover over the field of view of the images.  However, this depends on the sun being high enough in the sky for the shading to work, which limits the total amount of time images can be collected each day.  

The shade size can always be increased or placed at an angle to account for the sun angle, however this increases cost, design complexity, and makes the platform more susceptible to wind gusts.  This time-limited window to collect images can be problematic due to the potential for storms to affect the QR codes.  Even if the QR codes are firmly planted in the ground and do not blow away, heavy rainfall can splash mud onto the codes decreasing the chance they'll be readable. 

Since the experiment was performed in October, when the sun only reaches a maximum altitude angle of 42 degrees in Salina, the decision was made to test the mapping process at night.  One disadvantage to mapping at night is the potential for the external lighting to attract insects which can fly into the camera's field of view.  From preliminary tests the LED bars did attract a few insects but not enough to negatively impact the usefulness of the images.

\section{Camera Setup}

The correct choice of camera options is another important step in making the mapping system robust for a given experiment.  Some of these options will vary in how they're determined between day and night-time mapping, because at night the available light is more restricted.  Since this experiment was performed at night, that is what is discussed here.

The first option selected is the shooting mode, as that defines what other settings are available to change.  The preferred shooting mode is Manual, because that will allow the exposure time, aperture, and sensitivity to be set to constant values.  Under controlled lighting conditions this will keep a consistent image intensity and prevent any additional latency due to the camera calculating these settings before each image.

The maximum exposure time is determined based on the speed of the robot and maximum allowed translation in the QR codes.  If the exposure time is set too high the black and white squares making up the QR codes will start to blend together, rendering the code unreadable.  It was experimentally determined that an exposure time of 2.5 milliseconds, or 1/400 seconds, was sufficient for quality QR code images.  At a nominal speed of 40 cm/sec this results in a translation of 1 millimeter during the exposure time.  Even though this is the same size as the grid squares, there are enough pixels per square that the blending was negligible. 

The aperture is set to a large diameter to maximize the amount of light reaching the sensor since the exposure time is relatively short for the amount of light available.  When the lens is fully open (an f-stop of f/2.8) the depth of field is noticeable reduced, and it becomes more difficult to keep the QR codes in focus as the camera height slightly varies as it moves through the field.  Therefore, an f-stop of f/4 is preferable as it provides a good trade-off between depth of field and exposed light.  In addition, compared to f/2.8 an aperture of f/4 will have less noticeable lens effects such as distortion and vignetting, which results in higher quality images.  

The light sensitivity of the sensor, commonly specified as an \ac{iso} rating, is set last by inspecting the image in the field to achieve a desirable scene brightness.  Using the two \ac{led} bars per camera required an \ac{iso} of 1000.  If the ISO is set too high then sensor noise becomes significant.  If too high of an \ac{iso} is required, then the aperture can be made larger or the external light can be increased.  

The white-balance is set to a fixed setting chosen to match the same temperature of light as the LED bars, which is listed in the product description as 6000 Kelvins.  Many cameras offer both a Flash and Cloudy white balance which are both centered around 6000K.   Preliminary field tests indicate both options produce very similar results, so the Flash setting was used.  Auto-white balance mode should not be used as most images will not contain a QR code for reference, and as a result many images of plants will vary in chromacity. 

Finally, the image format is selected between raw and the \ac{jpg} format.  Raw images store the pixel readings directly from the sensor, thus no information from the exposed image is lost.  The \ac{jpg} format on the other hand typically merges adjacent pixels from the Bayer filter and applies a compression algorithm to reduce the file size.  Even though the compression algorithm produces image artifacts that reduces the quality of the images, this does not reduce the effectiveness of the post-process pipeline.  For the Canon 7D camera, raw image are around 15 megabytes larger then \ac{jpg} and require a conversion to a bitmap format before being useful for post-processing.  This conversion requires approximately 5 to 10 seconds per image and adds a significant amount of additional processing time.  For these reason the \ac{jpg} format was used for this experiment.

\section{Robot Operation}

In section \ref{section:base_functionality} it was discussed that the robot can operate in either cruise control mode or a fully autonomous mode.  In this experiment the robot was used in cruise control mode, mainly because at the time there were not any tools available to view and edit the waypoints used by the robot.  When generating a set of waypoints from the transplanter path, the waypoints at the row ends need to be edited to prevent the robot from driving in too rough of field conditions, as well as to prevent from turning before the end of the row and running over plants.  Even though the robot was operating in cruise control mode, the path of the robot was recorded, and it's possible to have the robot retrace this path in fully autonomous mode.
