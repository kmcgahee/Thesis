address at transplanter?  One-time shot if things mess up.  Difficult to identify plants.  Constant stopping, too much motion and difficult shading make its not ideal for images.

\section{Coordinate Systems}

  - important of systems
  - what systems are used and why they're used. Maybe make these subsections?
  - orientation representation and offsets - standard in datacollection program

\section{Projection Model}
 
 - going from 3d to 2d
 - pinhole model - maybe reference?
 - assumption about ground being flat. 
 - platform stability
